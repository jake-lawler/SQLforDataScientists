These are my notes on 'SQL for Data Scientists' by Renée M. P. Teate.


Here are the sources I referred to to get MySQL up-and-running from within R Markdown:

* The answer from 'Harley' [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50544230/connecting-to-mysql-from-r) on connecting to MySQL.

* The [reference page](https://rmariadb.r-dbi.org/reference/index.html) for RMariaDB.

* The information on including SQL in R Markdown from Yihui Xie's [R Markdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#sql).

Here's an example of the code I'm using to connect to the book's example database, I'll hide this in the future chapters:

```{r}
# Setting up 
library(DBI)

# Connect to the book's example MySQL database
con <- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), 
             dbname = "farmers_market", 
             host = "localhost", 
             port = 3306,
             user = "root",
             password = keyring::key_get("mysql", "root"))

# No limit on the number of records to be displayed
knitr::opts_knit$set(sql.max.print = NA)
```

I've used the keyring package to store my database password. The password is initially set by running code like the following in the console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
keyring::key_set_with_value("mysql", username = "root", password = "password123")
```

And then running the following code will return the value "password123":

```{r eval = FALSE}
keyring::key_get("mysql", "root")
```


You can then run queries by using R Markdown's support for SQL code snippets:

```{sql connection=con, max.print = 10}
SELECT * FROM farmers_market.product
```


Then disconnecting the database at the end of each chapter:

```{r}
# Disconnecting the database
dbDisconnect(con)
```
